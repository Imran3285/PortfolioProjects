# Objectives

I am a results-driven master’s student in Data Science for Business with a strong statistical foundation. Skilled in Python, SQL, R, and advanced BI tools, I transform raw data into actionable business insights. I am passionate about solving real-world problems through quantitative analysis, building predictive models, and understanding the risks, impacts, and costs that influence business decisions. My experience across data science and analytics projects has enabled me to automate analysis workflows, identify patterns in large datasets, and deliver insights more quickly and accurately than manual methods. I am eager to apply my data manipulation and analytical skills in an organisation that values innovation and sustainable business growth.

# Skills I Own
- Interested in understanding business objectives, core values, and the key factors that drive success, enabling better alignment between analytics and organisational goals.
- Strong at analysing how a business functions and identifying critical problems to solve, recognising that misconceptions can lead to poor decisions.
- Skilled in gathering the right data by engaging with stakeholders, researching online sources, reviewing company documents, and analysing customer feedback.
- Experienced in transforming raw data into clean, structured datasets, performing exploratory analysis using SQL and Excel, and ensuring data quality and reliability.
- Enjoy working with Python to conduct in-depth analysis, automate workflows, and build efficient analytical models to support data-driven decision-making.
- Demonstrated ability through previous projects to visualise data effectively, extract meaningful insights, and evaluate results using data-focused tools.  
- Confident in communicating insights and visualisations to teams and stakeholders to support clear understanding, better decisions, and successful project outcomes.

# Projects' Experience

**NEXTBIKE CYCLE HIRE CONSULTANCY PROJECT**

I am leading a cross-academic project aimed at strengthening Stirling’s Nextbike cycling infrastructure in support of Scotland’s Net Zero 2045 goals. This paid project involves analysing over 150,000 trip records across five years to uncover usage patterns around university zones, residential areas, and tourist hotspots. I model station-level shortages and surpluses using inflow–outflow dynamics and am developing a K-Mean based redistribution strategy to guide optimal bike rebalancing, docking-station placement, and resource allocation. My analysis identified the university zone as consistently bike-deficient, with surplus availability in Bridge of Allan during off-peak hours. I am also planning to implement the EAST behavioural framework, in collaboration with Stirling Council and Santander Bikes, to increase public engagement and improve system reliability.

**RETAIL ANALYTICS AND PREDICTIVE MODELLING FOR JC PENNY**

I recently completed a consultancy-focused data analysis project for JC Penney, a premium American retail brand, where I used Python and data manipulation techniques to uncover insights from product, review, and customer datasets. By applying tools such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and TextBlob, I analysed pricing structures, customer sentiments, and purchasing behaviours to support strategic decision-making and business growth. The findings highlighted that JC Penney’s core customer base is middle-aged, most products are priced under $100, premium categories like jewellery and home goods drive higher price points, and customer satisfaction remains average with ratings around 3.0–3.5. These insights informed recommendations around improving product quality, strengthening youth market engagement, refining loyalty schemes, and repositioning the brand to align with modern retail expectations.

**LEVERAGING DATA SCIENCE TO SUPPORT GREEN TRANSITIONS**

In this dissertation project, I used Power BI and the CRISP–DM framework to gather, transform, and analyze transport data, evaluating the impact of electrification, bike sharing, and Low-Emission Zones (LEZs) across Scotland.
The McKinsey 7-Step Framework helped me develop an issue tree and formulate hypotheses that were tested after the data evaluation.
Found that 75% of EV charging infrastructure in Stirling uses AC-type chargers, cycling is highly seasonal and influenced by geography, and LEZs reduced pollutants by 14% within just six months, significantly contributing to decarbonization.
I also analyzed geographical demand for each scheme using time series, geospatial, and comparative analysis, and examined current developments to propose data-driven recommendations.

**TELECOM CUSTOMER TARGETING USING MACHINE LEARNING**

Developed a machine learning model to help a telecom company optimize marketing for a new mobile contract. Used advanced statitics for data cleaning, model tuning, and deep insights, I tested logistic regression, decision tree, and neural network algorithms — selecting the neural network for its 77.5% accuracy. The model identified key customer factors influencing purchases, enabling data-driven targeting and improved marketing efficiency.
