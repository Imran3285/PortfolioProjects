My proficiency in Python, SQL, R, and advanced BI tools helps me transform raw data into actionable business insights. I am interested in solving business problems using quantitative data, building models, and understanding the impacts, risks, and costs associated with those businesses. My experience working with machine learning enables me to automate the process of analyzing and identifying patterns in large datasets much faster and more accurately than through manual analysis. I look forward to applying my soft and hard skills in an organization that prioritizes innovation and technological growth.
