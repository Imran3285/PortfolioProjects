# Objectives

I am a results-driven MSc Data Science for Business graduate with a strong Electrical Engineering foundation and experience delivering consultancy-led analytics projects across transport, retail, and commercial strategy.

I specialise in transforming raw, complex datasets into actionable business insights using Python, SQL, R, and Business Intelligence tools. My work combines statistical modelling, machine learning, forecasting (Prophet & SARIMA), and structured problem-solving frameworks such as CRISP–DM and the McKinsey 7-Step approach.

Through academic, consultancy, and leadership roles, I have:

- Built time-series forecasting models to optimise workforce and operational planning

- Delivered £2,500+ projected monthly revenue improvements through data-driven strategy

- Demonstrated £11m ROI in public infrastructure through mobility analytics

- Designed predictive and segmentation models identifying $2M+ revenue opportunities

I am passionate about solving real-world business and sustainability challenges through quantitative analysis, predictive modelling, and structured decision-making. I am seeking opportunities in Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, or Data Science where innovation and measurable impact are valued.
